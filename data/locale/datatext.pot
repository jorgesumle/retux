msgid "What?! They're taking my fish?!"

msgid "The reign of the Snow King is over!"
msgstr ""

msgid "What?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm taking him out! There's no way I'm letting him take away my fish!"

"I am Tux, and I am putting an end to the Snow King's reign, one castle at "

"So it is you! The rebellious penguin who would see to it that our king's "
"reign ends!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm sorry to inform you, Tux, but your treason ends now."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You act as if you are rebelling against the Fish Tax, but we know what "

msgid ""
"I don't know how you found out about our secret plans, but you will not "

"In my search for the elusive Tux Dolls, I have learned that the name of each "
"level often hides a clue. Perhaps, if I can decipher these clues, I can "

"Fire can be a great way to melt ice blocking access to certain Tux dolls. "

"I swear, there are no fire flowers anywhere in this level! How am I "

"It is said that this level contains 7 springs, but I have only managed to "

"That pipe to the right is too high to be reached even by jumping off a "
"spring. It would be possible if that Jumpy could be magically suspended in "

"I have found that if, when holding a fire flower, I hold down the \"up\" "
